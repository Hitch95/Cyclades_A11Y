# Cyclades A11Y

The goal of this project is to enhance the design and accessibility features of the [Cyclades](https://candidat.examens-concours.gouv.fr/cyccandidat/portal/accueil?codeER=&domaine=) website.

## Project Overview

This project is divided into two main components: the frontend and the backend.

### Frontend

The frontend is built using the following technologies:

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/): A next-generation frontend tooling that provides a faster and leaner development experience.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types.
- [React](https://react.dev/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The frontend is currently deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### Backend

The backend is built using the following technologies:

- [Deno](https://deno.com/): A modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that is secure by default.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types.
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/): A lightweight, disk-based database that doesn't require a separate server process.

## Design

The design for this project is created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/tITLtWt8fb8qXBo5D3ykFn/Cyclades?node-id=1-2&t=MXg00dPxTn1BiBww-1).
